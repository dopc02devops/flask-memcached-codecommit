AWS CloudTrail
###############
    It enables you to monitor and log activity across your AWS account. It records all API calls and related events
    made within your account, offering a detailed record of changes, operations, and access to your AWS resources.
    These logs help with security analysis, auditing, compliance monitoring, and troubleshooting.

    CloudTrail records API calls made to AWS services. These API calls could come from the AWS Management Console,
    AWS SDKs, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), or other AWS services.
    It logs actions like CreateInstance, DeleteBucket, RunInstances, etc., along with metadata like the identity
    of the user or service that made the call, timestamp, and the specific resource affected.
    Trail:

    CloudTrail events are stored in S3 buckets for easy access and review.
    You can use tools like Amazon Athena to query logs or third-party tools to perform in-depth analysis of activity
    over time.
